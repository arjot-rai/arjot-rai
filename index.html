          <h2>Computer Science Student</h2>

          <p>
            Hi, my name is Arjot, I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the
            Univeristy of Saskatchewan. I started my journey towards getting this
            degree 2 years ago by taking the introductory course in CS
            without knowing that I would be choosing it as my major before the first
            term ended. My main interest lies in coding data strutures and algorithms. I plan to
            focus my degree towards Software Development while taking courses in
            Mathematics, AI, Machine Learning and Computer Networking. I am comfortable
            coding in Python, Java and Javascript, with intermediate knowledge in C and Assembly Language(MIPS).
            I most often use git for version control. I am confident with using SQL while
            using RDBMS such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite. Currently I am developing my skills as a Web Developer.
